I'm a seasoned DevOps professional with a knack for Python, Bash Scripting, Terraform, and Kubernetes. I'm currently pecking my way through the vast fields of Go – hoping to add it to my repertoire soon!

## 🧰 Skills
- **Languages:** Python, Bash
- **Tools:** Terraform, Kubernetes, and many other DevOps tools
- **Certifications:** Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) and Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)

## 👩‍💻 Philosophy
My approach to coding is simple: don't reinvent the wheel. If you don't need anything fancy, stick to the basics. My areas of interest are security, automation, and ensuring the smooth operations of all systems under my watch.

## 🐔 Personal Life
When I'm not clucking around with code, you can find me puzzling over corn mazes in the backyard, maintaining my nest to the highest standards, and enjoying a relaxing dust bath in the warm sunshine. 

Thanks for stopping by and getting to know me.
